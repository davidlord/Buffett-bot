# Buffett-bot

Creating a daytrading bot, mainly for educational purposes but also for fun :) 
Collaborative project, please add ideas and useful information in the wiki pages, feel free to add more wiki-pages as well. 

## ToDo: 

We will be focusing on either stocks (more specifically large-cap stocks) or crypto for this project. For now, please try out different trading strategies manually. Think algorithmically! Try to find a simple - yet profitable strategy that could be automated through code. Note down the strategies that work and we can back-test them in the next step! 

* Make use of indicators but try to keep it simple, do not want to integrate too many indicators in the decision process. 

* **Note**: Avoid futures and funds. Futures due to the high risk and funds since the waiting time for orders is too long.
